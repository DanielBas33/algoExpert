# Complexity Analysis, Memory and Big O Notation

## Complexity Analysis

Complexity can be divided into time and space complexity. Time complexity is what we use to measure how much time an algorithm will take to find a solution whereas space complexity measures the memory this algrithm or solution uses. Generally we look for solutions with the best complexities in general so when we say complexity analysis we mean to the process of finding each of the complexities for our different solutions to one problem.

NOTE: Different data structures have different time and space complexities for the same actions.
